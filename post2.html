        <h2>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO RECYCLE USED CLOTHING?</h2>

        <p>Negative impact on the environment begins during production, and continues to have consequences throughout 				the life-cycle. Quite possibly the biggest issue is that most textiles are simply thrown away after being used. 				Most used clothing ends up in landfill, and a lot of that gets incinerated. This results in the industry 				wasting even more energy and water.
			
			<br/><br/>
			
			The good news, however, is that industries focused on recycling and reusing textile are slowly emerging and getting stronger. 
			Given that textiles also contribute a lot to greenhouse gas emissions, it’s important to take steps towards textile recycling and to improve all the practices that go along with it. For this and many other reasons, recycling textiles can help save the environment and establish a circular economy that will save money.
			
			<br/><br/>
			Let us first define “textile recycling.” This is a process of gathering various textiles and clothing and recovering them for further material use or reusing them as clothes once again. The recycling industry in the United States is regulated by SMART (Association of Wiping Materials, Used Clothing, and Fiber Industries).
			
			The importance of textile recycling is growing each year. The worldwide annual production of garments has exceeded 80 billion, and the EPA reports that the textile MSW (municipal solid waste) accounts for around 6% of the total number.
			
			<br/><br/>
			

			At the moment, the textiles derived from used footwear and clothing amounts to approximately 15%, meaning that there is still a long way to go with textile recycling. Since most of the textile materials are still thrown away, we have much more to accomplish before we can completely remove the need for landfills.

			The total amount of textiles which were recycled in 2015 is 2.5 million tons, meaning there are approximately 20 more tons that are not recycled. More accurately, around 10 million tons of textile MSW were put into landfills. In the US, the amount of pre-consumer waste recycled is at around 75%, but it’s only 15% for post-consumer waste.</p>
