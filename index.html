			<br/>
          <p>Less than 3% of the world’s croplands are used for cotton for our clothes, yet it consumes nearly 25% of 		pesticides. Not only is that harmful to our planet, but it also kills thousands of farmers and producers each year who 		work surrounded by these chemicals and waste.We offer a huge variety of products. 
			  That is why we use environmentally-friendly materials to produce our clothes. To check some of them, please 			click on
			  the Our Products tab. We are using low-impact dyes, upcycling natural materials, and growing organic 				pesticide-free cotton.</p>
